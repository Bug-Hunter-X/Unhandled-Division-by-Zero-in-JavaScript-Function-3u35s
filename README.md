# Unhandled Division by Zero in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: failing to handle division by zero. The `foo` function incorrectly returns 0 when either input is 0.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in applications.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` in a JavaScript environment.
3. Run the code. Observe the unexpected behavior (or runtime error).
